What are the Xms and Xmx parameters when starting JVMs?


The flag Xmx specifies maximum memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), while Xms is specifies the initial memory allocation pool.

That means your JVM will be started with Xms amount of memory and will be able to use a maximum of Xmx amount of memory.

For example, starting a JVM like so will start it with 256MB of memory, and will allow the process to use up to 2048MB of memory:

java -Xmx2048m -Xms256m

The memory flag can also be specified in multiple sizes, such as kilobytes, megabytes, and so on.

-Xmx1024k
-Xmx512m
-Xmx8g

The Xms flag has no default value, and Xmx typically has a default value of 256MB. A common use for these flags is when you encounter a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError.
