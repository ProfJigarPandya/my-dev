THE WORD SCRAMBLER

This project can be used to scramble words from any file contain textual data.
It uses Python 3 to run the program.
It has two scrambling modules:

1) ScramblerUsingInbuilt:
        It uses inbuilt functions from random to shuffle the chars of words.
2) ScramblerUsingUserDefinedFunction:
        It does random swapping of chars to shuffle up the characters of the word to be scrambled.

The pseudo steps for the Word Scrambling Algorithm is as follows:

1) Read input file (assume it is read into variable "data").
2) Separate lines and words from data.
3) Scramble individual word as follow
    i)   Separate 1st and last character from the word.
    ii)  Check last character for punctuation:
            If punctuation is present shuffle all the characters except 1st,Last and 2ns Last character.
            Else shuffle all the characters except 1st and last characters.
    iii) Write the word into the file and also add new line character at the end of line.
4) Save and Close the file.
