Fibbonaci series is well known to programmer for learning programming itself in the beginning.


Surprisingly, below answer 

How many bit strings (i.e, sequences over{0,1}) of length 18 have no consecutive ones? (You may write a program to answer this question, although a calculator should also sufÔ¨Åce.)

6765, which is 18+3rd 21st term of fibonacci. If first 3 terms are ignored answer to above question can be given via looking at fib result.

I have tried drawing a tree, left branch labelled 0 and right branch labelled 1 and generating path text for all leaves specially avoiding routes where 1 to 1 are back to back. meaning right right following.

Mathametically, 
the logic to count not having consecutive 1's is 
Next term total valids <=  No. of zeroes current * 2 + number of ones current (..logically we will extend only of 0 both left and right and 1's toward zero only)
