/*
Find GCD of two posititve numbers using The Euclidean Algorithm.
Recall that the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers m and n is the largest number that divides both m and n.
The Euclidean Algorithm is a technique for quickly finding the GCD of two integers.
Define function named find_gcd which takes two numbers and returns a number. Use euclidean algorithm to implement find_gcd
function. Call find_gcd function from main with input numbers as arguments and print number returned by find_gcd function.
The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows:
If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.
If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.
Write A in quotient remainder form (A = Bâ‹…Q + R)
Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R)
