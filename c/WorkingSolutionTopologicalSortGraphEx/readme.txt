demograph.c demonstrates implementation of graph as a data structure.

The graph is dynamic and has following properties:
- directed
- vertex names have to be uniq
- circular linked list of vertices
- edgelist is linked list of all outgoing edges from a given vertex
- bfs - breadth first search uses simple queue from provided library
- dfs uses recursion for all siblings
- simple queue uses singular linked list from provided library
- _gn files/functions/struct are for graph nodes storage. Other regular files represent linked list/ queue of integers only.
- compile.sh file to compile in one shot.
- Compiles with gcc
